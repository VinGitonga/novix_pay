You're absolutely right! Let me correct the scope and add the recurring payments.

## **Corrected MVP Scope**

### **Phase 1: Core Payment Gateway**
**Workflow:**
1. **Business Registration**
   - Business connects wallet
   - Sets up payment preferences
   - Gets unique business ID

2. **Payment Link Generation**
   - Business creates payment link with amount/description
   - System generates unique URL
   - Business shares link

3. **Customer Payment Flow**

   - Connects wallet
   - Approves USDC payment via x402
   - Payment processed instantly

4. **Business Dashboard**
   - View all transactions
   - Track payment status
   - Basic analytics

### **Phase 2: Social Payments & Escrow + Recurring Payments**
**Workflow:**

   - Specifies recipient
   - Funds held in smart contract
   - Social bot sends payment link

2. **Recurring Payment Setup**
   - Business creates recurring payment plan
   - Sets frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Customer approves recurring authorization
   - Automatic payments triggered

3. **Payment Management**
   - Escrow: Recipient claims funds
   - Recurring: Automatic payments continue
   - Both: Manual cancellation/refund options

### **Phase 3: AI Agent Payment Infrastructure**
**Workflow:**

   - Agent owner registers AI service
   - Sets pricing per API call
   - Gets unique agent ID

2. **API Payment Gateway**
   - Other agents/users call AI service
   - System creates x402 payment for API call
   - Payment verified before API execution
   - Usage tracked and billed
